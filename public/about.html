    <i><p>My name is Daniel Cholakov.</p></i>
    <p>I come from Plovdiv, Bulgaria. I'm 21 year old student at Plovdiv University and at SoftUni Sofia. Currently I study Software Technologies and Design in PU and UI/UX Design in SoftUni. My goal is to become Full Stack Developer as early as my next birthday. For now my projects have been only design orientated so now I am trying new approach by making one of these Portfolio Web-Sites for every new language I take on in my adventure of becoming a Developer.</p>
    <b><i><p>"This is just the begining and with every new begining there are new Features more known as bugs" </p></i></b>
