   <center><h2>What is this Project about?</h2></center>
<center><p>This Projects main idea is for me to explore my knowledge of HTML and only HTML.
     As you can see there is no .CSS or .JSON files in here.
      Currently I am working on couple of Bootcamps and this is one of my little projects coocked from the people there.
       As the time goes and I get better with my skills I will continue to improve this site of mine and i will still only use HTML for it.
        Hope this will be good Practice for my problem solving skills!</p></center>
